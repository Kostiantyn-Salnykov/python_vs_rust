# python_vs_rust

This is not a challenge or benchmark comparison, this a simple documentation, that might be helpful for 
Python Software Engineers that want to learn Rust.

This documentation is designed for developers who know Python 🐍 (like me) in order to gradually understand Rust 🦀 by 
analyzing code examples and differences and similarities in these programming languages.
